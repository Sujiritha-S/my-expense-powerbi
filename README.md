# Personal Expense Analysis (2021-2022)

## Project Overview
This is my first Power BI project, where I transformed self-recorded personal expenses over a span of two years (2021–2022) into a dynamic Power BI dashboard. Initially, I tracked expenses informally, noting various daily spending for personal use. After learning Power BI, I decided to structure this data and visualize it meaningfully, uncovering spending trends and patterns across different categories.

- **Slicers & Filters**: Users can filter by year, month, and category to focus on specific insights.  

## Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel**: Used for organizing and preparing the raw data before importing into Power BI.
- **Power Query**: To manipulate and transform the data for analysis.
- **Power BI Desktop**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Used to create calculated measures like Total Expense, Avg Monthly Expense, Top Category, and Number of Transactions.

## Data Source & Preparation
- The data was self-collected and recorded in an Excel file for two semesters of my college life.
- I tracked all types of spending, daily expenses like food and transportation.
- The raw data was initially recorded in a basic format, and after learning Power BI, I organized it in Excel and used Power BI to create the interactive dashboard.

## Insights / Observations
- **Spending Trends**: Clear monthly fluctuations are visible, with certain months showing spikes due to events or higher personal spending.  
- **Top Categories**: Food and Transport account for the largest portion of expenses, followed by Shopping, Others, Phone Bill, and Entertainment.  
- **Transaction Insights**: The dashboard highlights 103 total transactions, helping to identify patterns in daily and monthly spending.  
- **Financial Planning**: This project provided practical insight into my spending behavior and encouraged better personal financial management.  

## Note
The data in this project does not include any direct college-related expenses such as tuition fees, books, or academic materials. Instead, it focuses on personal spending outside of the official college costs, such as daily living expenses, food, transportation, entertainment, and other non-college-related costs incurred while attending college.
