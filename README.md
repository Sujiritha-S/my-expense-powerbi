# My Expense â€“ Power BI Dashboard (2022)

## Project Overview
This is my first Power BI project, where I transformed self-recorded data of my expenses over a span of a year into a dynamic Power BI dashboard. Initially, I tracked these expenses informally, documenting various types of spending for personal use. Upon learning Power BI, I decided to organize and analyze this data in a more meaningful way by creating a comprehensive dashboard to visualize spending trends.

## Features / Highlights

Interactive Dashboard: The Power BI dashboard provides an overview of all expenses across multiple categories.

Expense Breakdown: Visuals such as bar charts and pie charts to show spending distribution by category (e.g., transportation, food, entertainment, etc.).

Time-Based Insights: A line chart to track how spending fluctuated over the course of a year.

Category-wise Analysis: Ability to filter and drill down into specific categories to identify patterns and trends.

Slicers & Filters: Users can interact with slicers to examine data by different periods or categories.

## Data Source

The data was self-collected and recorded in an Excel file for two semesters of my college life.

I tracked all types of spending, daily expenses like food and transportation.

The raw data was initially recorded in a basic format, and after learning Power BI, I organized it in Excel and used Power BI to create the interactive dashboard.

## Tools & Technologies

Power BI Desktop: For data visualization and dashboard creation.

Microsoft Excel: Used for organizing and preparing the raw data before importing into Power BI.

Power Query: To manipulate and transform the data for analysis.

## Insights / Observations

Spending Trends: The dashboard reveals how my spending changed over two semesters of my college years, with notable spikes in certain periods (e.g., the start of a semester).

Category Breakdown: Food and transport formed the largest share of my expenses.

Financial Planning: This project helped me understand my spending behavior and prompted me to plan better for future expenses.

## Note

The data in this project does not include any direct college-related expenses such as tuition fees, books, or academic materials. Instead, it focuses on personal spending outside of the official college costs, such as daily living expenses, food, transportation, entertainment, and other non-college-related costs incurred while attending college.
